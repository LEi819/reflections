1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a repository but there is no commit in it.
So we are able to make commit for all the files inside the repository.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is like a buffer between working direcory and repository.

3.How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
After I make a logical change to a file in working directory, I will use command git add to add it to staging area and use command git commit to add a commit for the logical change.
