How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Viewing differences between two versions provides developers both intended and unintended changes. Those unintended changes could be bugs.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It allows programmer know which part of the file has been changed.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros are only necessary commits are created.
Cons are programmers may not create necessary commits.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
In programming, multiple files may be linked with each other. Thus, those changes may be related.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can always return to the previous version by git checkout.
