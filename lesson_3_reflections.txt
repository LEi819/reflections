1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I want to share the code with others.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some changes on the remote may only be temporary.

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork allows you to make a copy of somebody else's repository directly on the Github servers.
Clone allows you to make a copy of a repository either on the same pc or from Github to a local pc.
Branch is a idea in the local repository.
